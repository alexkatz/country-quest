# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

- **Dev server:** `pnpm dev`
- **Build:** `pnpm build` (runs `tsc -b && vite build`)
- **Lint:** `pnpm lint` (ESLint + Prettier check)
- **Format:** `pnpm format`
- **Preview production build:** `pnpm preview`

No test suite exists yet.

## Architecture

React 19 + TypeScript SPA built with Vite. React Compiler is enabled via `babel-plugin-react-compiler` in `vite.config.ts`. Tailwind v4 is used for styling; the `tw()` helper in `src/layout/tw.ts` wraps `tailwind-merge`.

### Game concept

The player is given a **start country** and an **end country** (randomly chosen at a set distance apart). They type country names to "reveal" intermediate countries. The round completes when start and end are contiguously connected through revealed countries via shared borders. Post-round, a BFS finds the shortest winning path through the revealed countries and compares it to the pre-computed optimal path.

### State management — Jotai

State is split across two files:

- **`src/game/state.ts`** — all game logic atoms:
  - Base atoms: `startCountryAtom`, `endCountryAtom`, `revealedCountriesAtom`, `optimalPathAtom`, `termAtom` (search input text), `roundAtom`, `maxPathSizeAtom`
  - Display toggles (persisted via `atomWithStorage`): `showAllCountriesAtom`, `showAllNamesAtom`, `showDebugInfoAtom`, `showHelpAtom`
  - Derived atoms: `connectedRevealedCountriesAtom`, `isRoundCompleteAtom`, `winningPathAtom`, `missedOptimalPathAtom`, `revealedNonOptimalAtom`, `roundScoreSummary`
- **`src/map/state.ts`** — visual/globe atoms: `hoveredCountryAtom`, `lastCenteredCountriesAtom`, `mouseGlobePosAtom`, plus constants for globe size, scale limits, sensitivity, `KEYBOARD_ZOOM_STEP`, and spring configs.

### Globe rendering — `src/map/useDrawMap.ts`

Canvas-based rendering using a **d3-geo orthographic projection**. Runs a continuous `requestAnimationFrame` loop. Globe rotation and zoom are animated with `@react-spring/web` spring values (`rotX/Y/Z`, `scale`) passed into the hook. Country fill colors are determined by game state (terminal, connected, revealed, optimal, unrevealed) and read from CSS custom properties via `getColors()` (cached after first call). Countries too small to render as polygons get a dot + circle outline instead (area threshold < 2 in projection units).

Hover detection (`src/map/useMapGestures.ts`) uses `geoContains` for normal countries. For small countries, a fallback circle hit-test runs if nothing was found: `smallCountryIds` is precomputed once at module load (same area threshold), and the fallback checks if the mouse is within 6px of the projected centroid — matching the drawn circle radius.

### Country data — `src/map/countries.ts` + `src/map/processGeoData.ts`

TopoJSON (`src/map/data/countries-simplified.json`) is loaded in `countries.ts`, passed through `processGeoData()`, and mapped to the exported `countries` array — the sole source of truth for all country data. `countryGeoData` is internal and not exported. All geo processing lives in `src/map/processGeoData.ts`:

- **`NAME_OVERRIDES`** — normalizes abbreviated TopoJSON names to full names.
- **`OMITTED_COUNTRIES`** — set of country names filtered out before processing (small/remote islands, isolated dead ends). Organized by region: Caribbean, Atlantic, Indian Ocean, Pacific, Antarctic, European microstates.
- **Polygon stripping** — removes offshore territories baked into parent country `MultiPolygon`s: Spain (Canary Islands), Portugal (Madeira, Azores), Netherlands (Bonaire etc.), South Africa (Prince Edward Islands).
- **Territory extraction** — splits France's `MultiPolygon` into separate named features: mainland France, French Guiana, Mayotte, Réunion, New Caledonia. Caribbean polygons (~-61°W) and other strays are dropped. Similarly extracts Galápagos Islands from Ecuador.

`Country` type: `{ id: string, name: string, feature: GeoJSON Feature, centroid: [lonRad, latRad] }`.

### Border graph — `src/game/`

- `borders.ts` — static adjacency map `Record<string, string[]>` listing neighboring country names. Includes land borders and water crossings up to ~200 km, plus explicit exceptions for gameplay (e.g. Bering Strait, Greenland/Iceland, Australia/NZ). Countries absent from the map (omitted or not yet added) are silently ignored by `getNeighbors`.
- `getNeighbors.ts` — looks up neighbors for a `Country` from the borders map, filtering out any names not present in `countryByName`.
- `getConnectedGroup.ts` — BFS to find all countries reachable from a seed within a given set. Also exports `areCountriesConnected` helper.
- `getRandomPath.ts` — BFS from a random start, picks an end exactly `length` hops away, returns the connecting path.
- `countryByName.ts` — `Map<string, Country>` for O(1) name lookups.

### Fuzzy search — `src/layout/common/fuzzy.ts`

Lightweight custom fuzzy search used in `NavInput` to filter and rank country suggestions. `normalize()` strips accents (Unicode-aware). `fuzzyMatch()` checks if query characters appear in order. `score()` ranks by exact → prefix → partial match.

### Cross-component events — `src/map/globeEvents.ts`

Typed multi-event pub/sub used to drive globe animation without prop drilling. `globeEvents.sub(event, handler)` registers a listener and returns an unsubscribe function; `globeEvents.emit(event, payload)` fires all listeners. Two event types:

- `'center'` (`CenterCountriesHandler`) — rotates the globe to center on a list of countries. Accepts `{ countries, scaleToFit? }`. When `scaleToFit` is `true`, zoom is adjusted if needed: scale is only reduced (zoomed out) to the minimum required to fit all countries in view; it is never increased.
- `'scale'` (`ScaleHandler`) — adjusts zoom by a delta value.

`useOnGlobeEvents` (in `Map`) subscribes to both events and springs the rotation/scale. `useOnRevealCountry` watches `revealedCountriesAtom` and emits `'center'` when a new country is revealed.

### CountryPill events — `src/app/createCountryPillEvents.ts`

Factory function that returns `{ onMouseEnter, onFocus, onClick }` — all call `globeEvents.emit('center', [country])`. Spread directly onto `<CountryPill>` props to wire map centering from any pill in the UI.

### Keyboard handling — `src/app/useOnKeyDown.ts`

Global `keydown` listener attached in `NavBar`. Behaviors:

- **ArrowLeft/Right** — navigate between country pills in the same row (`data-country-pill` attribute).
- **ArrowUp/Down** — navigate between pill rows (`data-pill-row` attribute), preserving column position.
- **Shift+ArrowUp/Down** — zoom in/out via `globeEvents.emit('scale', ±KEYBOARD_ZOOM_STEP)`.
- **Escape** — centers globe on start + end countries and blurs any focused pill.
- **Any printable character** — focuses the search input (if the round is still in progress).

Uses React 19's `useEffectEvent` to avoid stale closures.

### Styling notes

- Tailwind v4 — CSS custom properties (`--color-background`, `--color-text`, `--color-surface`, `--color-terminal`, `--color-connected`, `--color-optimal`) are defined in CSS and consumed both by Tailwind classes and by `getColors()` for canvas rendering.
- `getColors()` caches on first call. If colors change at runtime (theme switch etc.), the cache must be invalidated manually.
- `CountryPill` uses a `data-country-pill` attribute for keyboard navigation DOM selection.
